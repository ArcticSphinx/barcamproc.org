    ### Registration is easy!

    1. [**Fill out our simple registration Google form**](#{data.global.registration})
    2. Keep the "Edit your response" link after you finish the form, or submit a new entry if you change your mind.  We'll do the right thing.
    3. Put **Saturday, #{data.global.next_date} on your calendar**. Remember, check-in begins around 8:00AM, with the first presentations starting at 9:00AM.

    See you at BarCamp!
